# armadillo-party
6.885 Final Project

Armadillo Party is a simple game involving a single word master who
accepts/rejects words based on a rule. The rule must be a function of only the
word. The players attempt to deduce the rule by guessing example words.

My project uses the MIT Sketch language as the backend to deduce a user
supplied rule.
